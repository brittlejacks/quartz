# Report to July 15
# Monthly Report Structure
Monthly report on progress of Stories on the Estate: *Scéaltaí a’ tsráid*. I wanted to process one earlier after discussions about your reporting.

### Time Period: June-July 15

### Description of work:
A brief description of work carried out.

This period began with organisation and execution of the launch. The launch was attended by about 30 persons. Was MC-ed by Director, Theresa Brady, with speeches from the Minister for Communities, and the Lord Mayor of Belfast. The event was well received. Received coverage in the Andersontown News and via the social media of both the Minister and Mayor. 

Schedule(s) for the project were determined. At first, this opted for volunteer recruitment and training first. After discussions these were revised to put elements of research first with recruitment and training beginning in October.

Equipment and online subscriptions were paid after research: H5N Pro recorder, SD card, British Newspaper Archive subscription, Irish Newspaper Archive subscription.

Early June also included work at PRONI. A request to open closed files at PRONI related to the Twinbrook Tennants Association has been raised. Additionally, key dates and events have been identified such as the foundation date, first opened house, and changing amenities on the estate.

A small number of first interviewees have been identified with invites to be determined: Coraline, Frances, and Féilim - and Victor to a differing extent.

Additionally, community interest has been raised. I was interviewed by the Anderstontown News, conducted discussions with a number of attendees at the centre, and a discussion at length with Victor.

### Summary of Research Outcomes:
#### Cultural
Identified as an area still in need of further research. Documents currently held by Ionad na Fuiseoige and within Féilim's work do not offer substantial information. The PhD references Irish language on the Estate, but only by reference.

Holdings of newspapers and periodicals in the Linen Hall Library may offer more evidence. Will contact Féilim for interview with Irish language as a specific topic.

#### Ecclesiastical
Current holdings at Ionad na Fuiseogie offer information on the ancient ecclesiastical history of the area. Newspapers and other resources offer further information about religious history on the estate.

#### Social
Féilim's PhD offered substantial source material, especially related to dates on the estate, social campaigns, demographics, and change. A number of primary sources are referenced which will be worthy seeking out for reference.

Key dates have been identified, including the first house, Feb 1971. A timeline of events is a key piece of work underway. Key social changes and movements have also been identified including, of especial interest, the Peace Peoples' establishment at Twinbrook and the connection of the Maguire Seven.

#### Sporting
Identified as an area in need of further research. 

### Additional:
Ethical framework and interview agreement completed, included pending approval.

### Schedule:
No events are currentled scheduled.

### Problems / Blockages:

**Identified and solved:** The National Lottery Heritage Fund contacted to update usage of logos. They advised that [new logos](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/funding/logo) were now in operation and to ensure they are used on any *future* releases, productions, or events. One of these is bilingual Béarla/Gaeilge and have opted to use this in future.
