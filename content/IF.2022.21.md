By signing this form you are agreeing to take part in the project, Stories on the Estate: _Scéaltaí a’ tsráid_, by means of recorded interview (or by donation of original items or their copies).

## The Project & Collection

Stories on the Estate: _Scéaltaí a’ tsráid_ is a heritage project run by Ionad na Fuiseoige and made possible by the funding of the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The project will examine the first 50 years of life on the Twinbrook Estate by archiving oral histories and documents in the public interest. These interviews and documents have public value beyond the immediate interests of Ionad na Fuiseoige.

The project will utilise archived material in the production of an online heritage map, an onsite installation at Ionad na Fuiseoige, and interpretive panels throughout the community. Information learnt from interviews will be used in the production of these outcomes. Extracts and quotations from interviews may be used in the production of these outcomes.

The information contained within the interview or donation (personal and sensitive data), will be stored in a secure, digital format; used for the purpose of completing the project, and; it may be made available, upon approved request, to future researchers. Ionad na Fuiseogie will store this data into perpetuity to preserve the oral history of the United Kingdom and Ireland for the purposes of archiving and inform the research of future generations.

You may request the partial or complete closure of your interview or donation to the public by statement on this form or, in writing, to the Heritage Project Co-ordinator at heriage@ionadnafusieogie.com or the director at theresa@ionadnafuisigoe.com.
