Feedback. From higher ups the issue will be with volunteers. We're going to struggle to get them turned around in time so we need to identify a key number right now and hope the rest come about okay. **There's not enough time built in to advertise and get volunteers**. Result: We need to get internal and await external. Maybe have two trainings where available.

This is the key issue.

Emailed sean, heard back, just double checking his time commitments. About 2 or three sessions. We need to get people onboard for these. Forwarded to Kevin to ask for any paperwork re these. In September, not August.
