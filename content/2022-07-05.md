# Tuesday 5 July
I have been working across a few things and not merely focused on the one. I am fascinated to learn about the Peace People movement. More information about the history of Twinbrook in th 1970s and the TTA and more reason to get files sorted with PRONI. I have to write that email ASAP. #daily #peacepeople #research
