# PhD

Essentially, Feilim argues that West Belfast was a ghetto organised so that a minority (within Belfast), Irish Nationalists, could express and organise themselves as though they were a majority. He does not argue that a ghetto is a categorically bad thing but that it is a different thing that is impacted by internal and external factors:

>The aim has been to describe the functions of the ghetto and to elucidate, whether the ghetto contributes positively or negatively to communal life both for wider society and for communities livin'g in ghetto-type environments. The aim has been to show that far from being dysfunctional, the ghetto has a function both in terms of the people living there and in terms of wider society itself.
>...
>This states that, whilst acknowledging the dysfunctional elements of ghetto existence for society generally, there are highly functional aspects of ghettos, both for the inhabitants and for wider society. On one level, the ghetto's very existence may provide a positive indicator that all may not be well in a particular society. On another level, it provides a minority community with the potential to carryon and develop its own community life and values in a dignified and respectable manner without impinging on the majority community, and in a way which would not be normally be tolerated in wider society. At the very least, it allows a minority group to continue to exist without being wiped out by the majority community.
>...
>In relation to West Belfast, it is clear that its formation into a nationalist ghetto was influenced by this need for security. External pressures forcing people into that area and internal attractive bonds both played a part.
>...
>The result can be that while an external threat remains, internal divisions within the community are set aside to cope with the common threat. This occurred in West Belfast, for example, for periods of varying length, during the aftermath of the August 1969 riots, the Falls Curfew, the introduction of internment, Bloody Sunday, the loyalist Strikes of 1974 and 1977, and to some extent during the Hunger Strike period. However, once the external threats subsided, the fragile unity also disintegrated and internal divisions began to manifest themselves once more.

As a source, Feilim's PhD is invaluable. While he does summarise the sources well, there is still investigation to do. Now a timeline needs tor be constructed around what he has said to build a picture around what we'll interview for. I also need more topical information on sport, as it something that was not address. Also more on the Irish language locally, as it was also weakly touched upon.

There will need to be more work on the [[IF.2022.20|Feilim PhD Notes Document]]
