## ==St Matthew's Parish Church==
### ==Notes from the 150th Anniversary Exhibition==

note: 

Welcome and introduction.

I'm an early career "public historian", that is, I work on heritage projects outside of a purely academic context. This has a great advantage from my own perspective of working with community groups - working with the people with the greatest connection to a historical story is always the most rewarding. Although it comes with its own perils!

The St Matthew's 150th Anniversary Exhibition came about through Queen's University's "Community Engagement" initiative. This included Dr. Olwen Purdue, Jackie Redpath, Tom Scott, Jacqueline Weir, and of course rev Tracey McRoberts, St Matthew's Rector. They got the gears turning on the project before my involvement and should thank them for their efforts up front, especially Jacqueline who allowed me ample access to the church's collections.

In the early stages of planning we all agreed that our exhibition for the 150th would focus on the connection between church and community and try to build upon the historical work already undertaken at the 1972 centenary and by other local historians. So, today also I don't want to simply rehash a narrative of times and dates but rather I want to highlight some of our findings and curiosities associated with the church. Much of this doesn't lead to neat answers rather it often asks more intriguing questions for further research on the church and the Shankill community.

Today I'll

Give a brief historical overview of St Matthew's Church

Outline findings regarding the famous shamrock shape of the building

Discuss the case of the Shankill Exhumations of 1869

Highlight how church records illustrate the changing urban and social landscape of the Shankill

Look at a few of the work undertaken to better understand ordinary lives in the Parish


When considering how to frame this presentation today I've decided to focus more on the **history work** which has been undertaken as part of assembling the St Matthew's 150th Anniversary Exhibition.

In the early stages of planning the exhibition we were well aware of the work of local historians and particularly the St Matthew's Centenary pamphlet produced in 1972. We didn't want to go over their old work, 

I recognise that I'm sitting amongst people who have a strong knowledge of your own local history already. I'm not proposing today tell you a history that you already know, but rather to focus on the work of the 150th anniversary and some of the interesting findings along the way. but obviously context

## ==Historical Outline==

note: The Shankill has been a site of ecclesiastical important throughout the written history of Ireland. Excavations conducted by Waterman in the 1950s support evidence of early habitation and Christian worship. 

St Matthew's traces its own history back to the original church on the Shankill, likely located within the vicinity of the Shankill Graveyard. Raymond Gillespie is an authority on medieval Belfast and certainly where I turned myself to construct the historical context of St Matthews.

In 1306 church assessments record 'The White Church with the chapels of the Ford, of Henrystown, and Westone'. The White Church, the parish church, was situated on the Shankill. At the time the Shankill Road comprised the key thoroughfare from Belfast, still a small hamlet near the Farset River, north toward the Antrim Hills. The White Church was rebuilt by Arthur Chichester in the early C17th but by the C18th its importance was waning. First, the chapel on the Ford supplanted it (St George's), only for it, in turn, to be supplanted by St Anne's. 

All the while the White Church on the Shankill fell into disrepair. In 1822 the foundations of the church were, unceremoniously removed from Shankill Graveyard. George Benn described the stone as being of such a sized that it had to be 'blasted with gunpowder' to remove it.

In the early years of Queen Victoria's reign, Rev. Dr Thomas Drew (of Christchurch, Durham St) erected a small chapel, pictured, at the corner of the graveyard. A little of this building is now incorporated in the Parish Hall (which, itself, was constructed as a School House in 1896). 

The congregation swelled and soon outgrew the small church. I'll discuss the construction of the new, current St Matthew's in a moment, so I'll pass over that period here. During the Home Rule crisis the church's rector Rev. Josiah Nicholson Sherman espoused his strong opposition to Home Rule and, later, his support of the 800 young men from the parish who enlisted to fight in First World War. Although Shearman passed away in 1915 to be succeeded in his post by Rev. Robert Walker whose own son, Claud a second-lieutenant with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, was killed in action in July 1916.

On the night of April 16, 1941, an incendiary device became lodged in the roof of St Matthew's. It didn't detonate as designed but burnt slowly. The small fire was extinguished with help from the nearby Methodist church. The Rectory on the Woodvale Road was heavily damaged by another bomb, fortunately with no casualties.

The was, of course, the Belfast Blitz and on the same night a parachute carrying a bomb fell to earth above the Shankill. It landed feet away from the Percy Street Air Raid Shelter, collapsing its walls in the explosion. There were no survivors. The Belfast Blitz of April and May 1941 killed 900 and injured another 1,500.

Change came quickly to the Shankill post war.  In the 1950s the greater Shankill area was home to almost 80,000 people but now it the population is just under 30,000. Urban planning played the greatest role in pushing people away from the Shankill but the turmoil of the Troubles didn't help either. In June 1972, a huge car bomb wrecked the Woodvale Arms. 18 people were injured in the explosion. Buildings within a 300-yard radius, including St Matthew’s, were badly damaged, and a crater four foot deep and eight foot wide was left in the road. Damage to St Matthew's required closure and repairs over the next year until a rededication in 1973. The Sunbeam Vogue's hood ornament remains at the church to this day and was included in the exhibition.

Note:

St Matthew's continues to serve it's parish and community, but for today I'd like to turn my focus now to some of the fascinating findings of my research work as part of the exhibition.

## =='An Enlarged Shamrock'==
### ==The Case of Belfast's Curiously Shaped Church==

note: Research indicates that the iconic shape of the church was not a coincidence but rather a happy consequence of the 'increasingly personal and idiosyncratic' designs of architects Welland & Gillespie. 
- Designs were seen and approved on 23 September 1870 by St Matthew's Vestry Committee
- Welland & Gillespie's contract with the Ecclesiastical Commissioned ended 31 December 1870 at disestablishment of the Church of Ireland
- Local constructers John Lowry & Son contracted to build the Church at a cost of £3,000
	- About £230,000 in today's money
- Church was built on land gifted by Sir William Ewart Lord Mayor, MP, and later 1st Baronet
- The new church held 700 parishioners

St Matthew's is a particularly striking building. As others have previously noted its design means that the congregation have an unobstructed view of pulpit. Although it's the aerial view of the building that has offered the greatest curiosity.

My research sadly hasn't found a smoking gun. By consulting the records of the Vestry there's a notable gap that coincides with 1870 and the disestablishment of the church of Ireland. However, previously un Although records illustrate the engagement of Wellend & Gillespie for the project and the RCB designs offer that representatives of St Matthew's witness and agreed to the plans. 

The Irish Dictionary of Architects suggests that the increasingly idiosyncratic designs of architects employed by Welland & Gillespie were chiefly 'Gothic' although HERoNI's historical building register argues that the style is Byzantine.

note: here from the Rector's Sermon Book a memorial service to William Ewart is noted. The Sermon Books offer brief glimpses into day-to-day life. One Rev Sherman was fond of noting snowfalls and Rev Walker noted episodes of violence during the 1920s Troubles.

![[Belfast Ground Plan.jpg]]

note: Bishop John MacNiece, Louis MacNiece's father, recorded that it was well known that the church should represent 'an enlarged shamrock'. Evident that anyone agreeing to this plan would recognise the shape of this building and the ongoing connection between it and St Patrick which the room on the ground floor beneath gallery is now named.

**Shape is unique within the UK and possibly within Ireland as well**

note: Symbols of Irishness that may be closely associated with nationalism or the Republic today were very much in vouge at the time. Twenty years after the consecration of St Matthew's at the Ulster Unionist Convention of 1892 event facilities erected near what is today the Holyland area and Queen's PEC depict shamrocks, harps, and event a touch of the Irish language "Erin go bragh" (Ireland forever)

## ==The Shankill Exhumations==

<!-- slide bg="[[9191426648_d1ba000858_o.jpg]]"-->

note: 

The Shankill Graveyard was the churchyard of the original Shankill church. Excavations there in 1955 identified not only religious items but items of daily life supporting claims that the area was a site of ecclesiastical importance as early as the ninth century. But these 1955 excavations weren't the only ones with at least one moment forgotten in Belfast's history

In 1869, work on Belfast’s new burial grounds, the Belfast Cemetery on the Falls Road, was completed. Consequently, the town sought the closure of its ‘overcrowded cemeteries’ on the Stranmillis and Shankill Roads a process which went before the Privy Council in Dublin.

Proceedings were complicated by religious differences, and were also noteworthy for presence of Isaac Butt QC and MP (and counsel in the libel trial of Oscar Wilde’s father) representing the Catholic Church’s interest in Friar’s Bush Graveyard. Indeed, an entire digression could be possible here just to discuss Butt's cavalier approach to the hearings in what is a tangential, but probably the closest, connection between the Wildes and the Shankill. 

Orders from the Privy Council were first reported in the Belfast press:

Internments in Belfast must take place under these rules, and the public had better study them carefully, so that they might not infringe them. As there were certain penalties attached to them …

– Belfast Morning News, 21 July, 1869.

The interpretation of these orders, however, was contested in Town Council. The burials at Shankill Graveyard – limited to what was declared ‘old ground’ – did not infringe the new rules but concern, and then panic, spread amongst the public. The disturbances of early August 1869 (see opposite) were only put to an end by the intervention of the Mayor and were reported as far afield as the United States and Australia.

Burials, however, continued under the new rules with many recorded in St Matthew’s Burial Register. Reportedly, the last burials took place in the 1950s. Records of the gravestones are kept at PRONI.

## ==Changing Times==
### ==St Matthew's in the industrial city==
<!-- slide bg="[[media_470529.jpg]]"-->

<!-- slide bg="[[1860 - large.png]]"-->

note: In the 1820s George Benn, the earliest biographer of Belfast city, described Shankill as a village about a mile distant from Belfast. It was comprised of white-washed cottages, footways, and bleaching greens. Similar villages existed at Ardoyne and Springfield and these all fell within St Matthew's Parish. Raymond Gillespie estimates the population between these villages and the countryside beyond at a smidge over 2000.

OS Map, 1860 showing Shankill and Springfield Roads. Obviously from a later date but you can still see a distinction. 

This rural setting, however, was rapidly changing.
--
<!-- slide bg="[[1900 - large.png]]"-->
Note: The same area in 1900, note the massive increase in urban and industrial sprawl. Belfast's population had increased from 25,000 in 1800 to over 365,000 at the century's end.

These maps were particularly popular at the Exhibition with our school groups. These offered a tactile way of appreciating how much the physical streetscape around them had changed.

St Matthew's itself is visible. That land given to church by William Ewart was associated with Brookfield Mill, the chimneys of which loomed over the church and the graveyard.

--
![[media_458198.jpg]]
Note: Changing work and occupation. This is reflected in the Marriage Book records of St Matthews. The marriage registry show that fathers and witnesses to weddings listed their occupation as ‘farmer’. This had all changed by the end of the century.

## ==Ordinary Lives==

<!-- slide bg="[[9180446841_b6e7bb9c62_o.jpg]]"-->

Note: Our exhibition sought to examine the ordinary lives of parishioner's and highlight how St Matthew's itself was involved in the greater movement of social history beyond the confines of church walls.

The wonderful selection of Parish Magazines held by St Matthew's was the first port of call. These give a glimpse into church life, going into great detail to describe picnics, guide and scout events, bazaars and sales of wares, and excursions for children to Whitehead and Bangor - perhaps the furthest many had ever gotten from the city. While that's how I accessed these, there's incredible scope for further work - numerous adverts offer local historians a chance to piece together the commercial streetscape of the Shankill area.

But additional records, especially the marriage and baptism registers, which have been digitised by PRONI, offered a further valuable glimpse into the everyday lives of working class residents.

As part of the project I selected and researched a number of individuals who appeared in the baptism register in search of interesting stories. In fairness, time was a major constraint and there is still much work to be done in this regard, I wish I could have followed many more leads, however, what was obvious was that hardship was amongst the most common aspect of all.

Baptism records, specifically, for St Matthew's stretch back to 1893. I made a selection of individuals, born prior to the 1901 census - this was so I could aim to find two census records for that person - and aimed to see how far I could track their lives.

## Ellen Dyer

![[ellen dryer 1893 1.png]]
![[image (3).png]]
Note: Ellen Dyer was born to Robert and Maria on 6 May, 1893. The family lived at 268 Crimea Street. Robert was a ‘gaslighter’ an occupation that likely made him a familiar face. When Ellen was 8, the 1901 census recorded the family living now in East Belfast, Moorfield Road. Here they remained in 1911 when the now 18-year-old Ellen was recorded as ‘Nellie Dyer’, occupation ‘Hemstitcher' (below). Such a small change evidences a touch of personality to a young woman born in the 19th century.

It's worth noting that records indicate that working class families moved quite freely between the Shankill and East Belfast. While the Dyers did not return to St Matthew's Parish, I've noticed on returning to this research that 36 Oakland Avenue, where Nellie responded to the 1911 census, is actually around the corner from where I now live myself.

### Elizabeth Bryans
![[bryans 1893.png]]

![[richard bryans.png]]
note: Elizabeth Anne Bryans was both to William and Margaret of 50 Geoffrey Street. While many moved between the Shankill and East Belfast at this time the Bryans remained local and involved in church life. In 1901 they had moved to Glenwood Street and, in 1911, they are recorded at Ainsworth Avenue. Elizabeth's occupation was listed as 'Thread Winder in mill'. Perhaps she worked in the nearby Brookfield Linen Mill?

Elizabeth’s younger brother, Richard, was born in 1896 and baptised in St Matthew’s. In 1911 his occupation was listed as a message boy. Richard served in the Royal Army Medical Corp and survived the war. His pension record lists him as disabled due to a shrapnel wound to the right knee.

36 Oakland avenue which I've just realised is around the corner from me today 

--
### Robert McKee

![[robert mckee.png]]

Note: Robert McKee is slightly different to others here. His name appears in assoication with the church but records aren't as clear. What is clear, however, is that he served in the First World War sadly killed in an accident at Rossglass. His grave is still there at Star of the Sea.

Similar searches for soldiers and individuals involved with the Titanic were embarked on and would be a natural extension of this work.

## ==Conclusion and Thanks==

![[IMG_20220308_151023_747.jpg | 400]]


note: Shankill Crozier, excavated from the graveyard in the mid C19th illustrates early connections with the church. Jackie Redpath was instrumental in bringing these to the Shankill from NMI. Amongst items referenced in negotiations around partition, it was their first time returning to the Shankill since their excavation. 

Story - I enjoyed that got a garda with them.
