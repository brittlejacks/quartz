# Thursday 23 June

08:40 - You should finish around 15:00

What needs to get done today:
- ~~Feilim Reading and notes~~
- Rejig timelines again
- Plans to ensure mgmt of project possible within current restraints

Today consisted mostly of reading. Tuesday will be more effective/productive by setting out and using your time consistently.

Feilim's dissertation is extremely useful. Most often what is needed on top of this is fnding of locations.

Today I imaged to find the exact house that Chichester-Clark visited on opening the estate. [[IF.2022.20]]
