Theresa came to me to discuss tour training. CNP are not offering us training that we can jump on with them anymore. Angela knows of someone who can help us out with training, a 6-8 week course, for 6-8 volunteers. Ask Angela.

Lorraine, of Born and Bred in Twinbrook, could be a great source for advertising outward as well.
