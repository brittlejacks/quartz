Today we dealt with the Christmas tree and car in the mroning and then I went to watch Dundela v Ards in the first round of the Irish Cup. Dundela won 3-2 in what was mostly a dominant performance until Ards suddenly kicked to life with 10 minutes to go. Sin√©ad was upset with me this evening and it seemed to have more to do with her not feeling great. I want to help out and can only keep trying.

Thinking about when Mum and Dad are here:

Tuesday 1 Feb - Wed 16

I definitely need to take 1-3 and 15-6 off. That would cover my flex going in and leaving. 

Galway, 4-6 or 11-13? Leaning towards latter. Could do 6-7 North Coast and stay at a hotel or something in Portrush?

What's going on re car?
