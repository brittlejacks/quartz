# Wednesday 13 July
Have been working on Feilim's PhD. Theresa again wants a report. But I can't see when we agreed to it. I'll set a date and work to that. 

Today I am working on finished the PhD reading; setting a report date and structure; responding to PRONI email. And Red Cross work.

Got a lot of the tasks before me out of the way and then had a really interesting discussion with Coraline and Frances. I would like to interview them both.
