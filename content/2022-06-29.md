# Wednesday 29 June
Continue working on Feilim Material and notes, try to pick up the pace. Consider the upcoming preso. Annie material has taken a back step for now, but keep in mind. Jump to some of the folder material as well, #Odhr√°n.

Today I mainly built flat pack furniture. Definite struggle to focus. Need to mix things up tomorrow, send some emails and do some wheeling and dealing - make yourself feel like the project is yours rather than ruminating on it. 

Looks like next few weeks will be tough.

Did 8 hours
