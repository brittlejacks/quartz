# Report

Hi both,

Wanted to send a short email over with a brief report along the lines of some of the work going forward before our catch up Monday. I'll keep it brief.

Advisory Panel

Met with the AP and been in regular contact. I believe I have looped you both into the email re our actions from first meeting. 

Working on description for additional members.

Recruit Vols

Have been working with Eleanor Mason. Role description approved (student intern can fit within at later date). Eleanor offered some more contacts to work with here re recruitment.

AP and EM worried about timeline for recruitment and number of volunteers - as feedback.

Select In-House interviews

AP gave a number of names. Have asked them to make a list of names each with brief biographical sketch of who's who to send back.

QUB Training

Sean says he can do two to three sessions in September. 

Digital

Meeting with ProfileTree scheduled

Evaluation

Have linked with Jamie Curran and he is interested. Sent information but have no heard back again - Jamie is on holidays at the minute so I understand.

Misc.

Derry successful. I have the McCorkell collection until end of August can extend. I have read Lady McCorkell's book and AP have further unpublished material to read. Background info on British and Irish Red Cross at the moment. 

Timeline is ready for approvals. I think we can get cracking on some stuff sooner than though, interviews etc.
