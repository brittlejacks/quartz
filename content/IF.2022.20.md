## Twinbrook History

### Earliest History

Population growth caused the physical expansion of Belfast in the latter half of the C19th. While wealthier citizens moved north and south, poorer residents were pushed west and east. Catholic population remained, mainly, to the west of the city. 

>Nowadays, the area of Catholic predominance extends west, then south-west along the Falls Road, past Andersontown and out as far as Twinbrook Estate. Its apex, where it comes nearest the city centre, is in Castle Street.
>p. 154

West Belfast has maintained social/physical connections with the country beyond the Falls Road - something stressed by Estyn Evans (1944). The Catholics of Belfast had their spiritual needs administered by the chapel at Derriaghy for many years. In the more distant past there existed the church of KIllwee / *Cill Uaige* (The Church at the burying place) near present day Twinbrook from which the as Gaeilge name of the estate arises. Killwee was one of the chapels associated with the Church of Shankill. 

### C20th Century
#### Housing
Faced with housing shortages after the Second World War the Northern Ireland Housing Trust embarked on a programme of construction of new, suburban hosing particularly on the peripheries of Belfast and other towns/cities.

>For these new estates, "the primary objective of the planners was to create a balanced neighbourhood within a new urban community" {49}
>p. 155

Twinbrook, originally known as Dunmurry-Stewartstown Road estate, was one of these. It was designed to take the overflow population from the redevelopment of the Lower Falls and Lower Shankill. Thus, it was intended to be a mixed estate and the first residents were drawn in such a manner to provide a mixed, working class community.

In September 1965 the NIHT earmarked 170 acres of land off the Stewartstown Road. In 1968-1969 essential roads for Twinbrook were begun and in 1970 work on the first 297 houses. {52} On 17 February 1971 the first house was opened by PM Chictester-Clark {Found on BBC Rewind; I have identifed this as 1 Laburnum Row}. By Oct 1971 171 dwellings were completed with 605 under contract, 379 under construction. {53} 

*Correspondence, N.I.H.E., 28/2/85, Op. cit.*

Local residents had opposed the contrsuction of the new estate on NIMBY lines. The main argument was the derogation of the atmosphere of the village of Dunmurry. The Dunmurry Society was the main opposition group. {55} {Court cases/appeals referenced in PRONI and papers}.

*Ulster Star, 25/10/69, p.15. See also Ulster Star Editions on 15/11/69, p.19; 21/2/70, 25/7/70. Common, R., "Irish Troubles", Town and Country Planning, Vol. 38 1970, pp.401-404.*

Antrim County Council originally refused planning permission for the Summerhill/Thronhill phase of the scheme. 

Early relationships between Twinbrook and Dumurry were coridal but in 1972 with the change in the former's demographics there was a deterioration.

The estate was built in stages, prompted by the needs first of rehousing redevelopment residents, and then as the Troubles progressed, by the need to rehouse the ever growing West Belfast population.

**INFO ON NIHE HERE**

NIHE was aware of demand for new housing in the early 1970s. In 1973 an internal document estimated that 7,200 Catholic families were in need of accommodation in W Belfast. 3,900 were already on the waiting list, 300 on the Emergency list, and a further 3,000 needed rehoused from redevelopment areas. 

> "the natural growth of Catholic West Belfast alone will produce at least 600 families per annum". {59}

> Some residents felt that because of the massive need to build housing quickly in West Belfast in the early 1970s the expansion of Twinbrook had not been properly planned. Instead the emphasis had been on housebuilding to the detriment of providing services for the existing community. {This should be a research focus}

Juniper / Laburnum and Glasvey finished first. 1971. Then Almond Drive/Broom area built 1971 opened 1972. Finally Thronhill/Summerhill 1975/77. Final area, Cherry/Aspen and extension of old Glasvey 1978/79. {61}

*Interview T21. See also Figure 2:C in Chapter Two showing a plan of Twinbrook Estate.*

Final housing (of this round of build) copleted by late 1970s. 1,642 dwellings had been completed: 444 dlates, 180 'pensioner bungalows', 1020 houses.

Twinbrook consists of sub-areas where the housing is concentrated. 

#### Origins of the Population

Twinbrook, built on the outskirts of Belfast, was a new community with little continuity of social bonds. With two exceptions:
- The first residents in the Juniper area came together from the Lower Falls and Lower Shankill bringing some pre-existing connections
- Refugees arriving in 1971 and 1972 from Rathcoole and East Belfast brought with them their own connections

Protestant families, mainly in Juniper, began moving out in 1972 and 1973 and Catholic families took up their homes, often by squatting. These new Catholic families came most often from what had previously been mixed areas in Belfast. They experienced violence, threat, and burnouts.

Key differences between early families and later ones: much earlier larger families from across Belfast communities. Later younger couples from mostly West Belfast/one community.

Population of the estate quickly grew to around 7 000 but had dropped back down to 5 500 by the mid-1980s. Due to movement toward the new Poleglass Estate.

Twinbrook was a relatively young area with approximately 50% of its population under the ages of 20!
- 850 under the age of 5 (15% of population)
	- Compared with an average of 7% across Belfast
- 1 000 aged between 5 and 11 (18%)
- 1 000 aged between 12 and 20 (18%)

{74. *N.I.H.E. General Household Survey, N.I.H.E., Belfast 1986*.}

There were a high number of single-parent families on the estate, around 13% of families. Feilim indicates issues with the figures in this regard.

A study conducted by Blackman et al indicated that in 1988 **unemployment** on the estate included 37% of men and 28% of females (economically active) and that up to 85% of households existed on the poverty line.

Almost 80% of households received housing benefits in 1986 according to NIHE.

#### Housing Conditions

Houses in Twinbrook were of good quality and had both front and rear gardens. Originally they were constructed with central heating - a luxury at the time - which was controlled centrally. The District Heating Oil-Fired Boiler was located near the current site of Ionad na Fuiseoige. Pressures from rising costs and demand resulted in issues with the supply of heat during the mid 1970s. A subsequent campaign to remove the District System was successful, with each both gaining individual central heating. 

Overcrowding was a problem on the early estate: 26% of families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions {83. *Blackman et aI, 1988, Ope cit.*}

There was a low tenant turnover after the initial influx of refugees. The exception to the rule were local flats. The higher turnover of their tenants was influenced by the NIHE policy of moving families out of Twinbrook's flats for new houses in the new Poleglass Estate during the 1980s. Flats were backfilled with individuals and/or childless couples

Anecdotally many Twinbrook residents decided to remain and few moved out of the Estate (or the additionally area of Poleglass). {90. *Interview T.22.*}

Poor maintenance and high levels of squatting were identified as key issues in Feilim's work.{91. *Correspondence, Anne Johnston, 5/12/84, op. cit.*}


#### Services and Amenities

Early services and amenities were particularly poor in the earliest days of the estate. Especially singled out was public transport.

Marooned close to Lisburn with most people actually needing transport to Belfast the estate had poor bus **and** black taxi links. Although this was improved by the mid 1980s.

Two 'wooden huts' serviced as the centre of social and recreational life on the estate during the 1970s. One was utilised by the Tenants' Association as a social club (and small pub) until 1977 when it was burnt down and not replaced.

The second served as a youth club until a later, purpose built, Church Youth Club, was constructed in the 1980s.

The L.E.S.A established a club in 1972. It was taken over by one nationalist faction and was destroyed in a bombing, injuring one woman in November 1975 {See newspaper reports}

>L.E.S.A. (League of Ex-Servicemens Association) was set up in a number of nationalist areas of Belfast in the early 1970s to act as a quasi-defence force, independant of the mainstream republican groupings. Several of these groups eatablished social clubs for their members.

In 1974 a pub opened on the Stewartstown Road. It was the scene of political disturbances such as those recorded in the {94. *Andersonstown News 14/12/74.*}

Regarding health. There were no doctors or dentists until the 1980s when both services came in the form of a health centre. There was a chemist from 1976/1977.

The Post Office was first established in a vacant house in the Juniper area. It had been an NIHE sub-office previously. Many residents complained of the small size of the post office which forced them to queue outside. {*Interview T.9*}


Post office was provided in a vacant house in Juniper area which had been an NIHE sub-office. Although many complaints about the small size of the post office

One Catholic Secondary and two Catholic Primary Schools. St Marks had originally been built to cater for Protestant children but became a catholic school {96} when protestant families left. 



Schools were overcrowded and demountable buildingswere common in the 70s and 80s. The secondary school ddevelopeda bad reputation and during the 1980s some parents refused to send their children there. 

During the development of Poleglass Republican, Clubs and local tenant groups  wanted the new development not to experience 
> the grossly insufficient social and recreational facilities available in Twinbrook, Twinbrook according to them, had experienced 'inadequate planning and the rapid building of housing units without the necessary development of community and recreational facilities'" {97}

*Planning Appeals Commission, Poleglass Area Public Inquiry, H.M.S.O., Belfast 1977. Section III, Mr.Flood*

Feilim quote the Department of Environment as arguing the Deptwere reluctant to provide facilities until such time that the population was 'established' which had been exacerbated by the influx of refugees and squatting {98}. Local residents believed it was directed at them. 

*Personal Correspondence, Anne Johnston, N.I.H.E., op.cit 15/12/84.*

Local residents were responsible for building thjeir own football pitches

A playground was provided, a health centre, dentist etc. provided in the early  1980s

>By the time the research was carried out in 1984/5 the estate was also serviced by a chip shop, a bakery, 2 local supermarkets, 1 newsagent, 1 general store, a hairdresser a chemist and by two social clubs and three public houses, two of which contained restaurants.
