# OHNI Conference Explainer

Headline:

The Oral History Network of Ireland is Ireland's internationally recongised body representing anyone involved in the practise of oral history on the island. Attendance is important for networking and keeping our project relevant nationally - it raises its profile and allows us to find and engage with other practicioners and their work.

This is the first in person conference since the pandemic: Maynooth, July 1-2 (Fri-Sat). We have been invited to a short session, the Moments Session, where we describe our project and take questions for around 10 minutes. It hasn't been sceduled yet. There are costs involved in attending: €80 for non-members and €50 for non-member concession.

More information:

The Oral History Network of Ireland is *the* body comprising those involved in the practice of oral history on the island of Ireland. It provides a connection between the work of academics and practicioners (projects like ours) and the enitre conference is best suited to dialogue and networking. OHNI is an internationally recognised academic body in the heritage sector.

Attending the conference keeps our work relevant and allows us to enter into more academic "dialogue". We'll have an opporunity to pick up ideas from around Ireland and to illustrate the value/rigiour in what we're doing (and why the NLHF was right to invest in us).

I attended the online conference in 2021 and it was valuable at the end of the project. A couple of things I have learnt from attending in the past:
- There is usually slim to nil representation from the North (apart from academics)
- Academics/practioners are wary of any project that courts media attention and shuns conferences (keeps you on the good side)
- Committing to returning will keep our work relevant over a few years and allow us the present a paper on findings as we progress

I proposed an introductory paper on the project for their annual conference. We've been accepted for a slightly different session on organisers' advice. The 2022 annual conference at Maynooth University July 1 & 2.

The theme for the conference is "Memory and Oral History": 

> Questions of memory abound in oral history. In collecting oral histories, we invite interviewees to recall now distant places and events. We ask them to explain to us and to future listeners what their experiences were and how they felt. In turn our interviewees recall, remember, and even redefine these memories. What is remembered, how it is remembered, what is forgotten and why are key questions for oral historians and the focus of this year’s conference.

I think this neatly ties into a lot of the conversations I've even begun having, where individuals look back on their lives and define them from exactly where they are now. 

I've accepted an invite for the moments session which they describe as 'Moments session - here you present for 10 minutes and then have more time for Q&A and feedback from the floor'. The session is smaller and better geared towards an early stage project and with multiple presenters to disscuss aspects of the project. 

I'm awaiting exact confirmation on the day we would be presenting but it's been highlighted to me that, if we all attneded, we would all have to pay registration which is €80 for non-members and €50 for non-members concession (I still have an active QUB card). ****These are early-bird rates until Friday!*** I realise this is an extra expense and I'd suggest it comes from either the project's contigency budgetline. Alternatively, we can review attendance arrangements.

There are sessions being hosted that would be valuable to attend. Particularly Workshop A which discusses interviewing and I would be curious to see someone tackle this to build my own workshops off of. Guy Beiner, for what it's worth, is an academic who has been keenly interested in memory in Ulster/the North. Although his work tends to border, politely, on the impenetrable. Greatly respected in the field but not as popularly well known as Eamonn Phoenix or Diarmaid Ferriter etc.
